<h1>Managing FreeBSD Jails Manually</h1>

<p>If you are tired of using frameworks that complicate your server
management and the implied restrictions that often are imposed to
make everything seem easy-to-do, this is the right article for you
as a <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html">FreeBSD Jails</a> manager.

<p>This article is an adaptation of the original <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails-application.html">FreeBSD Handbook section about
managing multiple jails</a>.
It tidies up some directories and makes most things work out-of-the-box, so that
you don't need to ask yourself why things don't work like you expect.</p>

<p>It is assumed that you want to install all your jails in the directory
<code>/jails</code>. You should also compile world which should match your jail host.
The directory where the sources are is <code>/usr/src</code> here.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Please watch your step! I don't want to be held responsible for
damaged data or hosts or whatever. You need to understand parts
of the jail concept and you need to know that jails look exactly
like you main host. Deleting a directory on your main host or
misconfigure it will upset you and your users.</p>

<p><em>Think before typing</em> and check that I haven't done mistakes
while writing this article.</p>

<p>I repeat once again: these are very low-level operations and
require an experienced administrator.</p>

<h2>Remove old rootfs master</h2>

<p>You can skip this procedure, when you have never installed any
previous jails with the method described in this article.</p>

<p>When updating the <code>mroot</code> tree, all jails need to be
stopped and their filesystems need to be unmounted.
It is not possible to update the jail's rootfs while it is running.</p>

<p>The <code>mroot</code> is moved in a safe place, so you can restore it
when the updated jail does not work instantly and people are
impatient about service downtimes.</p>

<p><code><code>cd /jails
chflags -R 0 mroot.bak
rm -rf mroot.bak
mv mroot mroot.bak
</code></code></p>

<h2>Bootstrap rootfs master</h2>

<p>In this section the <code>mroot</code> master rootfs is created.
It is not used for a specific jail, but for all jails at
same time, and for this reason, it
should be kept equal for every jail which you will install on
your system. <code>mroot</code> is big, but since it is needed only
once for all you jail installations, the concept overall is
very lightweight.</p>

<p>This <code>mroot</code> will be mounted as a read-only <code>unionfs</code> in each jail.
Inside this read-only jail rootfs, there is the special mountpoint
<code>/s</code> which is used for writable files and configurations. The <code>mroot</code>
is prepared here to point to <code>/s</code> using softlinks for every writable
directory.</p>

<p><code><code>cd /jails
mkdir mroot
cd /usr/src
make installworld DESTDIR=/jails/mroot
cd /jails/mroot
chflags -R 0 var
rm -rf etc var boot
rmdir root tmp
mkdir s
ln -s s/etc etc
ln -s s/home home
ln -s s/root root
ln -s s/tmp tmp
ln -s s/var var
cd usr
mkdir ports
rmdir local obj
ln -s ../s/usr-local local
ln -s ../s/tmp/obj obj
</code></code></p>

<h2>Remove old skel master</h2>

<p>You can also skip this section, if you have never installed
jails with the method described in this article.</p>

<p><code><code>cd /jails
chflags -R 0 skel.bak
rm -rf skel.bak
mv skel skel.bak
</code></code></p>

<h2>Make a new skel master</h2>

<p><code>skel</code> is the master copy for the contents of <code>/s</code>.
You should make one for each jail that you want to use.</p>

<p><code>skel</code> is not big, but you make copies of it for individual <code>/s</code> directories
and since <code>/usr/local</code> of each jail is inside <code>/s</code>, it can get huge, if you
install many ports there.</p>

<p>Please notice that you need to replace the placeholder string <code>DNS-SERVER-IP</code> by
your DNS server IP and <code>example.org</code> by a valid domain name that you want to
use.</p>

<p>Also please notice that the jail created from this template will make it
start its own <code>sshd</code> (SSH daemon),
which allows remote logins. Don't add it to <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>, if you
don't like it. Most people might want it, though.</p>

<p><code><code>cd /jails
mkdir skel
cd skel
mergemaster -t /jails/skel/var/tmp/temproot -D /jails/skel -i
rm -rf .cshrc .profile bin boot dev lib libexec media mnt proc rescue sbin sys usr
mkdir usr-local home distfiles packages wrkdir tmp/obj
echo 'sshd_enable="YES"' &gt;&gt; etc/rc.conf
echo "domain example.org" &gt; etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver DNS-SERVER-IP" &gt;&gt; etc/resolv.conf
echo "IGNORE_FILES='.cshrc .profile COPYRIGHT /boot/device.hints'" &gt; etc/mergemaster.rc
</code></code></p>

<h2>Make a new jail</h2>

<p>This is simple, if you understood the last section about <code>skel</code>.
It is just needed to copy <code>skel</code> to a directory which you can
mount to <code>/s</code> later when you mount your jail filesystem tree.</p>

<p>I will call the jail <code>XXX</code> here, so you can easily see where it
needs to be replaced in the commands you type.</p>

<p>You need to copy the <code>skel</code> contents (which is a template for the
writable jail contents) to <code>XXX-s</code>. Please don't mix it up with
<code>XXX</code> here which is for the read-only rootfs and needs to stay empty for now.</p>

<p><code><code>cd /jails
cpdup skel XXX-s
</code></code></p>

<h2>Prepare jail filesystems</h2>

<p>Perhaps you can see clearer how it is managed, when you look at
the mount hierarchy for our new jail called <code>XXX</code>.</p>

<p>We mount mroot (as told above) read-only in the specific jail
rootfs. Then at its specific <code>/s</code> directory, we mount the
writable contents that we copied from the template <code>skel</code>.</p>

<p>We also need the ports tree from our jail host. It saves space
to make an union mount, which is also read-only. Though, you
will need some hacks in <code>/etc/make.conf</code> to make it work (see
further below).</p>

<p>We also add a <code>/usr/src</code> for the jail. You can also add it
with "<code>noauto</code>", if you don't like it to have <code>/usr/src</code>
always mounted in your jail.</p>

<p>In <code>/etc/fstab</code>, add:</p>

<p><code><code>/jails/mroot         /jails/XXX   nullfs  ro      0       0
/jails/XXX-s         /jails/XXX/s nullfs  rw      0       0
/usr/ports           /jails/XXX/usr/ports nullfs  ro      0       0
/usr/src             /jails/XXX/usr/src   nullfs  ro      0       0
</code></code></p>

<h2>Mount jail filesystems</h2>

<p>Since we don't want to restart the system, we mount the filesystem
tree manually.</p>

<p><code><code>mkdir /jails/XXX
zfs create pool/jails/XXX-s
mount /jails/XXX
mount /jails/XXX/usr/ports
cd /jails
cpdup skel XXX-s
mount /jails/XXX/s
</code></code></p>

<h2>Configurations for a new jail</h2>

<h3>Example <code>/etc/make.conf</code></h3>

<p>In case you don't use package build systems like
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/ports-poudriere.html">Poudriere</a> and
use portmaster or similar local build tools, you will need to make
these settings that should be modified for your jails (except for the
first three lines here with the directory paths).</p>

<p><code><code>DISTDIR=/s/distfiles
WRKDIRPREFIX=/s/wrkdir
PACKAGES=/s/packages
WITH_PKGNG=yes
MAKE_JOBS_NUMBER=3
WITHOUT_X11=yes
WITHOUT_GNOME=yes
</code></code></p>

<h3>Example <code>/etc/jail.conf</code></h3>

<p>This is the configuration for the jail host which makes
<code>/etc/rc.d/jail start XXX</code> work properly.</p>

<p>Replace <code>JAIL-IFACE</code> with the jail network interface
that the jail is going to be bound on.</p>

<p>Replace <code>IP4-ADDRESS-OF-JAIL</code> with the IP4 address you
would like to assign to the jail.</p>

<p>You need to repeat the <code>XXX { ... }</code> section for
every jail you have created.</p>

<p><code><code>exec.start = "/bin/sh /etc/rc";
exec.stop = "/bin/sh /etc/rc.shutdown";
exec.clean;
mount.devfs;
mount.fdescfs;
allow.sysvipc;
path = "/jails/$name";
interface = JAIL-IFACE;
</code>
<code>
XXX {
    host.hostname = "XXX.example.org";
    ip4.addr = IP4-ADDRESS-OF-JAIL;
    enforce_statfs = 1;
}
</code>
</code></p>

<h2><a name="jail-start"></a>Jail startup</h2>

<p>You can start your jail now.</p>

<p><code><code>/etc/rc.d/jail start XXX
</code></code></p>

<h2>Update a jail</h2>

<p>In case you have not created a jail by copying <code>skel</code>,
but updating it, you need to run <code>mergemaster</code> inside
it to update your system configurations. Remember that
<code>mroot</code> (rootfs) is now up-to-date, but the jail's configurations
need to be updated, too. You also need to <a href="#jail-start">start the jail</a>.</p>

<p>In case you decided to make your jail's <code>/usr/src</code> mounted
<code>noauto</code>, you will need to <code>mount /jails/XXX/usr/src</code> first
and after the procedure <code>umount /jails/XXX/usr/src</code> it again.</p>

<p><code><code>jexec XXX tcsh
mergemaster -iFU
exit
</code></code></p>

<h2>Final setup for new jails</h2>

<p>In case you have just updated jails, you can skip this
section.</p>

<p>You should verify with <code>jls</code> that your jail is really running.
Use the <code>JID</code> of the jail in the <code>jls</code> listing to enter a jail
with root shell.</p>

<p>Here, you setup the timezone, the root password and add your
first user (usually you, and you would like to add yourself to
the <code>wheel</code> group).</p>

<p><code><code>jls
jexec JID tcsh
tzsetup
passwd
adduser
</code></code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This guide shows how to setup a very lightweight FreeBSD jail
with enhanced security, because of read-only rootfs.
I have used this concept for years now and I am sure that it
works very well (I checked it on FreeBSD-10.2).</p>

<p>Email me mistakes, if you find any. There might be some and
I hope they are not fatal.</p>
